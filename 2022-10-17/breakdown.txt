You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. 
You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light 
and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

P: what if the string given is null or nothing at all
R: should return the next light color in order
E: 
given yellow, should return red
given green, should return yellow
given red, should return green
P:
create a function that takes in a string
create a switch statement to check for the states of light
return appropriate light value
