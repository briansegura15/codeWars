Complete the function that takes two integers (a, b, where a < b) 
and return an array of all integers between the input parameters, including them.

For example:

a = 1
b = 4
--> [1, 2, 3, 4]


P: what if the list is empty, what if the list is full of strings
R: should return every integer between and including a -> between
E:
given 5, 10 should return 5 6 7 8 9 10
given 20, 25 should return 20 21 22 23 24 25
given 30, 33 should return 30 31 32 33 
P:
create a function that takes in 2 parameters a and b
use a for loop to iterate over every integer
return every integer
