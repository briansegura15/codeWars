Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

Example(Input --> Output)

["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5" 

P: what if the array given is empty or contains numbers
R: should return found the needle at position +index
E:
["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] found the needle at position 5
P:
create a function that takes in an array
iterate over the array and filter out the needle
return a string with template literals with the correct message
