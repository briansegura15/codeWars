Create a function that takes 2 integers in form of a string as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string):

Example: (Input1, Input2 -->Output)

"4",  "5" --> "9"
"34", "5" --> "39"
"", "" --> "0"
"2", "" --> "2"
"-5", "3" --> "-2"
Notes:

If either input is an empty string, consider it as zero.

Inputs and the expected output will never exceed the signed 32-bit integer limit (2^31 - 1)

P: what if they supply a letter or null
R: return the sum of both integers supplied but in string form
E:
given 10 and 10 should return "20"
given 45 and 10 should return "55"
given 33 and 3 should return "36"
P:
create a function that takes in 2 integers in the form of strings
return the sum of the integers also in the form of strings
