Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.

Good luck!

P:
edgecases defined   
R:
return should be the string in alternating capilitaztion sequence
E:
given above
P:
create a function that takes in a string as parameter
split that string and use the map with index method
use a ternary to check if the index is odd or even and capitlize accordingly
use the nify swapcase to return both versions of capilitaztion
