Philip's just turned four and he wants to 
know how old he will be in various years 
in the future such as 2090 or 3044. His 
parents can't keep up calculating this so 
they've begged you to help them out by writing 
a programme that can answer Philip's endless questions.

Your task is to write a function that takes 
two parameters: the year of birth and the year 
to count years in relation to. As Philip is getting
 more curious every day he may soon want to know 
 how many years it was until he would be born, so 
 your function needs to work with both dates in the 
 future and in the past.

Provide output in this format: For dates in the future: 
"You are ... year(s) old." For dates in the past: 
"You will be born in ... year(s)." If the year of 
birth equals the year requested return: "You were 
born this very year!"

"..." are to be replaced by the number, followed 
and proceeded by a single space. Mind that you need 
to account for both "year" and "years", depending on 
the result.

Good Luck!

P:
what if we are given letters or null as parameters
R:
should return the correct statement depending on the given age after comparing first and second parameters
E:
given 2000 and 1990 should return u are 10 years old
P:
create a function that takes in 2 parameters
apply conditional and arithmetic
return correct statement
