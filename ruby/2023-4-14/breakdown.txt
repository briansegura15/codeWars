It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function 
that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, 
the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

P:
what if we are given null or integers
R: 
should return the string with the first and last element removed
E:
given what should return ha
given hello should return ell
given brian should return ria
P:
create a function that takes in a string as a parameter
apply ruby methods to modify string accordingly
return modified string
