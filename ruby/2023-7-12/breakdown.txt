Description
We need a function that can transform a string 
into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, 
and every string is a perfectly valid representation 
of an integral number.

P:
what if we are given null or NaN
R:
should return whatever string we are given in numerical form
E:
given "123" should return 123
P:
Create a function that takes in a string as a parameter
modify that string in order to return its integer form
return integer form
