You have an award-winning garden 
and every day the plants need exactly 40mm of water. 
You created a great piece of JavaScript to calculate the 
amount of water your plants will need when you have taken 
into consideration the amount of rain water that is forecast 
for the day. Your jealous neighbour hacked your computer and f
illed your code with bugs.

Your task is to debug the code before your plants die!

P:
what if we are given no number at all or NaN
R:
should return the correct statement after debugging
E:
P:
create a function that takes in milimeters as a parameter
use conditional logic to check if the mms given are more or less than the required 40 mms
return correct statement
