Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.

            P:
            what if we are given null or NaN
            R: 
            should return the given string in reverse order
            E:
            given hi should return ih
            given bye should return eyb
            given racecar should return racecar
            P:
            create a function that takes in a str as a param
            use the reverse method on the parameter
            return reversed str
