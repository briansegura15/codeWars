Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages.

Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need. If n < 0 or m < 0 return 0.

Example:
n= 5, m=5: 25
n=-5, m=5:  0

P: if given a negative should return 0, what if we are given a string?
R: return the total of n * m unless n or m is less than 0
E:
given n = 33 m = 1 should return 33
given n = 5 m = 2 should return 10
given n = -3 m = 555 should return 0
P:
Create a function that takes in 2 numbers
Use a conditional to check if the numbers are below 0
if they are not then simply multiply them together
return total
