Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! 
Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

i.e.

friend ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] `shouldBe` ["Ryan", "Mark"]
Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.

P: what if the list of strings is empty
R: should return every element in the list that is 4 letters long
E: 
given [brian carlos luis ryan] should return [luis ryan]
P:
create a function that takes a string as a parameter
use the filter method to iterate over the strings and check which one fits the discription 
return said strings
