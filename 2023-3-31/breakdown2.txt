Is the string uppercase?
Task
Create a method to see whether the string is ALL CAPS.

Examples (input -> output)
"c" -> False
"C" -> True
"hello I AM DONALD" -> False
"HELLO I AM DONALD" -> True
"ACSKLDFJSgSKLDFJSKLDFJ" -> False
"ACSKLDFJSGSKLDFJSKLDFJ" -> True
In this Kata, a string is said to be in ALL CAPS whenever it does not 
contain any lowercase letter so any string containing no letters at all
 is trivially considered to be in ALL CAPS.

 P:
 what if we are given numbers
 R:
 should return boolean value according to all elements being caps or not
 E:
 Examples are above
 P:
 create a function that takes in a string as a parameter
 simply use a return statement that returns if the str is .toUpperCase
