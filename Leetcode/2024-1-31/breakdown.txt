1. Two Sum

Hint
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.

P:
edgecases are defined above
R:
should return the indices of the 2 numbers that add up to the target numbers
E:
given above
P: 
create a function that takes in 2 parameters. an array of nums and a target number
instantiate a hashmap
loop over the array
check for a complement pair which would be the target number - the current number being iterated nums[i]
if it is found, return the index of the that complement pair and the index of the current iterated num[i]
else add the current nums[i] to the hash as a property and its index i as the value
