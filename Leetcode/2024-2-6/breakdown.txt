Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

P:
what if elements are null or 0 or NaN
R:
shuold return the k most frequent elements
E:
given above
P:
create a function that takes in an array of nums and an integer for k as parameters
create a hashmap
iterate over the nums array and push the values to the hash map
if the current element exists increment its value which is the amount that said element appears by 1
if it does not exists in the hashmap then give it a value of 1 apparitions
after our hashmap is established we are to return our answer from that hash
convert the hashmap into an array of key value pairs
sort the entries by the values(frequency) of all entries in descending order
after sorting extract only the keys from the sorted array transforming the key value pair into just key
use the slice method to return from 0 in the newest array up to k
