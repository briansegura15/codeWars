Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

P:
what if we are given numbers or Null
R:
true of false
E:
given above
P:
create a function that takes in 2 strings as parameters
break out of the function right away if the length of both strings are not the same
create an array full of 0s
iterate over the array with a for loop
-97 from every element in the first string and add that to the array
-97 from every element in the second string and subtract that to the array
return the array if every element in the array is 0 
if they are all 0 this would indicate true
(that was Judy's hardcore solution)
mine involved splitting the strings into an arrays, sorting the array in order, joining the array back together and then comparing both of those strings together
