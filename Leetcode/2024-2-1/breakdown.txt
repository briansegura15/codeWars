Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
Example 3:

Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]

P:
what if we are given numbers
R:
should return a new array with sub arrays of anagrams 
E:
given above
P:
create a function that takes in a array of strings as a parameter
instantiate a hashmap
loop through each string in the array
sort each string
if the sorted string is not in the hashmap add a new entry
if it is add the string to its subset
return just the values of the hashmap
