Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true

P:
what if input is Null or NaN
R:
true or false
E:
given above
P:
create a function that takes in an array of numbers as a parameter
use the super power called Set that returns an object of only unique elements from the supplied parameter
compare the size of the Set to the size of the original array 
if the size is the same, which would mean there are no duplicates then return true, if the size of the array differs it would indicate that there are duplicates and we should return false
