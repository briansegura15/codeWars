You are given the length and width of a 4-sided polygon. 
The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.
If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.

Example(Input1, Input2 --> Output):

6, 10 --> 32
3, 3 --> 9
Note: for the purposes of this kata you will assume that it is a square if its length 
and width are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.

P: what if this is inception and a square is not what it appears
R: should return area if a square or perimter if a rectangle
E:
given 5, 5 should return 25
given 2, 10 should return 24
given 3, 5 should return 16
P:
create a function that takes in the length and width of a given polygon
use conditionals to check if the polygon is a square or a rectangle
return the area or perimeter accordingly
