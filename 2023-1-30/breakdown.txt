Nathan loves cycling.

Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.

For example:

P:
what if we are given an argument of null or NaN or a string
R: 
for every hour Nathan cycles he consumes .5 liters of water. Return how many litres of water he drinks per workout
E:
given 1 hour of workout should return .5
given 2 hour of workout should return 1
given 4 hour of workout should return 2
P:
create a function that takes in hours of cycling as the parameter
