Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters:
 a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.

This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects -
 number of completed projects (from 0 and above);

This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
0, in other cases
Examples(Inputs-->Output):

100, 12 --> 100
99, 0 --> 100
10, 15 --> 100

85, 5 --> 90

55, 3 --> 75

55, 0 --> 0
20, 2 --> 0

P: what if we are given null or NaN or empty erthang
R: Should return final grade according to 2 arguments supplied
E:
given 100 and 15 should return 100
given 85 and 5 should return 90
given 1 and 0 should return 0
P: 
Create a function that takes in 2 parameters 
the first parameter should be an exam grade and the second a completed projects integer
We then use conditionals and comparison operators to verify which grade we should return
return grade accordingly
