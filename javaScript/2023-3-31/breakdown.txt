Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). 
Jaden is also known
 for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for 
 almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how 
 contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes 
from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

P:
what if we are given null or numbers
R: should return a string of words but with every first letter of every word capitalized
E:
given hi how are you should return Hi How Are Your
given its me mariio should return Its Me mariio
given welcome to the zen should return Welcome To The zen
P:
create a function that takes in a str as a parameter
split the string by words
map over the words and capitalize each first letter
rejoin the words
return the new string
