This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

Examples:
accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.

P:
what if we are given numbers instead of letters
R:
should return every letter of the string, first in capital then the amount of times according to its index
E:
above
P:
create a function that takes in a string
split the string into an array of elements to make it workable
use the map method to iterate and work on elements according to index
