Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. 
Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), 
are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1
The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

P: what if no input is given
R: should return any string but replace the 5 with s 0 with o and 1 with I
E:
given h1 should return hi
given hell0 should return hello
given 5h1n0 should return shino
P:
create a function that takes in a string as a parameter
turn the string into an array using split
iterate over the array
use conditionals to change the numbers into letters
rejoin and return the string
