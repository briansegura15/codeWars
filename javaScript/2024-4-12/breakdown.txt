Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from a to z. Return a new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.

Examples:
a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"

a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

P:
what if we are given numbers or null or NaN
R:
should return unique values from a combination of both strings in a sorted order
E:
given above
P:
create a function that takes in 2 strings as parameters
use the Set data structure in combination with the spread operator to combine both strings into the Set with only unique values.
Turn the default set result into an array by using the [...answer] syntax
now that you have an array use .sort and .join to turn the answer into a sorted string of unique values like we need
