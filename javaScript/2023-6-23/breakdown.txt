You probably know the "like" system from Facebook 
and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, 
pictures or other items. We want to create the 
text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement the function which takes an array 
containing the names of people that like an item. 
It must return the display text as shown in the 
examples:

P:
what if we are given null or void 
R: should return the correct message according to who liked the image
E:
given an array of names that like the image [bri qui lo] should return bri, qui and lo like this
given john max should return john and max like this
given alex jacbon mark max should return alex, jacbon and 2 others like this
P:
create a function that takes in an array
use conditionals to see how many elements are in the array
return the correct statement depending on the number of elements
