Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.

The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.

Examples(Operator, value1, value2) --> output
('+', 4, 7) --> 11
('-', 15, 18) --> -3
('*', 5, 5) --> 25
('/', 49, 7) --> 7

P: what if a negative integer is given, what if an invalid operator is given

R: function should return val1 combined with whatever val2 is after applying the operator which is the first arguments

E: 
given +, 10, 4 should return 14
given *, 1, 8 should return 8
given -, 30, 2 should return 28

P:
Create a function that takes in 3 arguments (operator, val1, val2)
return the result of val1 val2 combined with operator
