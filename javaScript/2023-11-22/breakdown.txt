You will be given a list of strings. You must sort it alphabetically (case-sensitive, and based on the ASCII values of the chars) and then return the first value.

The returned value must be a string, and have "***" between each of its letters.

You should not remove or add elements from/to the array.

P:
what if the words are numbers or null
R:

E:
given hi hello how are you should return h***i***
P:
create a function that takes in an array as a parameter
sort the array alphabetically and by ASCII
return the first value split by ***
