Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

Examples (Input -> Output):
* "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
* "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
* "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "
Good Luck!

P: what if null or an integer is supplied
R: should return a string where every character of the original string is repeated once
E:
given hi should return hhii
given aloha should return aalloohhaa
given teehee should return tteeeehheeee
P:
create a function that takes in a string as a parameter
split the string into an array of elements which represent each character
map over each of the charactesr and add another iteration of the character to it 
rejoin the array into a string
return the string with every character repeated once
