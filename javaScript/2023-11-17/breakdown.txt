I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

P:
what if we are given null or a negative number
R:
should return the result of adding both array integers together
E:
given 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 should return 12
P:
create a function that takes in 2 arrays as parameters
combine both arrays with the concat method
add all the elements in the new unified array together using reduce
return the result
