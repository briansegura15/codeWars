write me a function stringy that takes a size and returns a string of alternating 1s and 0s.

the string should start with a 1.

a string with size 6 should return :'101010'.

with size 4 should return : '1010'.

with size 12 should return : '101010101010'.

The size will always be positive and will only use whole numbers.x

P:
what if we are given a word or chars
R:
should return 1s and 0s according to the size argument
E:
given above
P:
create a function that takes in a number as a param
establish the return string with "1"
iterate over the number in the argument
for every integer that is even add a 0 to the string else add a 1 to the string
return string
