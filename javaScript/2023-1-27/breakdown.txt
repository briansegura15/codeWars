What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

Example(Input --> Output)

"apple ban" --> ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
"you will win" -->["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .

Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.

P:
what if we are given numbers as opposed to words
R:
should return the string in the form of an array and each word in the array should have a total count of letters in it
E:
given hi there should return [hi 2, there 5]
given me llamo BS should return [me 2, llamo 5, BS 2]
given woohoo should return [woohoo 6]
P:
Create a function that takes in a string as a parameter
turn the string into an array to work it by using the split method
return the array of words with the count of each letter
