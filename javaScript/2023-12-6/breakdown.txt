Return an array containing the numbers from 1 to N, where N is the parametered value.

Replace certain values however if any of the following conditions are met:

If the value is a multiple of 3: use the value "Fizz" instead
If the value is a multiple of 5: use the value "Buzz" instead
If the value is a multiple of 3 & 5: use the value "FizzBuzz" instead
N will never be less than 1.


P:
edgecase addressed above
R:
should return correct value according to divisibility
E:
address above
P:
create a function that takes in a number as a parameter
creata an empty array for the result
use a for loop to iterate until the number
use conditionals to check divisibility
if
