This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

Examples:
accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.

P:
what if we are given numbers or null as a parameter
R:
should return the parameter supplied broken down into the result provided
E:
examples above
P:
create a function accum that takes in a string as a parameter
split the string into an array of elements
map over each element of the array and capitalize the first letter as well as return the letter x times according the its position in the index
rejoin the array of elements with a -
return the result
