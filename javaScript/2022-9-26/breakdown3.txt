Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

For example:

Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.

P: Array will not be empty. If supplied with a negative number then obviously that is the smallest integer.

R: Return the smallest integer

E: 
If we are given [2, 155, 69, 23], should return 2
If we are given [-23, 43, 57, 99], should return -23
If we are given [189, 2345, 11, 0], should return 0

P:
We receieve an array of integers
Find a way to iterate over the elements in the array 
<---- After researching the best way is to use Rest Parameters ----->
determine the smallest integer
return said integer
