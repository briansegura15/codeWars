We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

For example: 
123  --> "123"
999  --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"

Paremeters: What happens if we are given special characters? what if we are given 0?

Return: Return the integer transformed into a string

Examples: 
 if we are given 69123, should return "69123"
 if we are given 23, should return "23"
 if we are given 007, should return "007"

 Pseudo: 
 Make a function that takes in an integer as a parameter
 use a method thats applicable to an integer that transforms said integer into a string
 return the string
