Fix the function
I created this function to add five to any number that was passed in to it and return the new value. 
It doesn't throw any errors but it returns the wrong number.

Can you help me fix the function?

P: what if we are given null or NaN
R: sh0ould return the new value after adding 5 to it
E: 
given 5 should return 10
given 10 should return 15
given 15 should return 20
P:
create a function that takes in an integer as a parameter
add 5 to the argument given
return the final umber
