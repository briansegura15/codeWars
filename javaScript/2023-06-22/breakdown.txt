Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a 
sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest.

For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"]

Your function would return the following array:

["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"]

All of the strings in the array passed to your function will be different 
lengths, so you will not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length.

P:
what if we are given an arrray of integers?
R:
should return the array of strings in order from smallest string to largest
E:
given hello how u doin, should return u how doin given hello
P:
create a fucntion that takes an array as a parameter
sort thru the array of strings and sort them accordingly
return the new array
