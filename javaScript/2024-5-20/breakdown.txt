A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

Return true if yes, false otherwise :)

P:
what if we are given null or NaN
R:
should return true or false
E: 
given 10 bullets and 5 dragons should return true
given 4 bullets and 5 dragons should return false
given 15 bullets and 7 dragons should return true
P:
create a function that takes in 2 params, bullets and dragons
if you have 2 bullets for every dragon, return true
return false otherwise
