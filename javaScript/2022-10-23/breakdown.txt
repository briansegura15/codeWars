everyone as they come aboard. It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!

Example output:

Hello, Mr. Spock

P: What if we are given null
R: should return the name of the parameter
E:
given Kirk should return Hello, Kirk
given Brian should return Hello, Brian
given M should return Hello, Mr
P: 
create a function that takes a name as a parameter
use template literals to return the name and sentence
