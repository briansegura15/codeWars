By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.

If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.

The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!

P:
edgecases have been defined and addressed
R:
should return null if the whole array is consecutive or return the first integer that is not consecutive
E:
above
P:
create a function that takes in an array as a parameter
sort the array 
check if every number in the array is consecutive or not
return the appropriate response
