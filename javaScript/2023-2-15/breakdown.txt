JavaScript Arrays support a filter function (starting in JavaScript 1.6). 
Use the filter functionality to complete the function given.

The solution would work like the following:

getEvenNumbers([2,4,5,6]) // should == [2,4,6]

P:
what if we are given null or an array of strings
R: 
should return only the even numbers of an array by using the filter method
E:
given 1 2 3 should return 2
given 1 2 3 6 9 10 should return 2 6 10
given 58 59 60 61 should return 58 60
P:
create a function that takes in an array as a parameter
use the filter method on the parameter
filter even numbers out and return them
