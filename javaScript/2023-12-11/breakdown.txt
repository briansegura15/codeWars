Given a 2D ( nested ) list ( array, vector, .. ) of size m * n, your task is to find the sum of the minimum values in each row.

For Example:

[ [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]        #  minimum value of row is 1
, [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]        #  minimum value of row is 5
, [ 20, 21, 34, 56, 100 ]  #  minimum value of row is 20
]
So the function should return 26 because the sum of the minimums is 1 + 5 + 20 = 26.

Note: You will always be given a non-empty list containing positive values.

P:
edgecases defined above
R:
return defined above
E:
examples given above
P:
create a function that takes in a 2d array as a parameter
use the .map HOF in order to iterate over each subarray and combine it with the Math.min method to establish all minimum values
use the reduce method in order to reduce these numbers to 1 value
return value
