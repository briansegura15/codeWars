The two oldest ages function/method needs to be completed. It should take an array of numbers as its argument and return the two highest numbers within the array. The returned value should be an array in the format [second oldest age,  oldest age].

The order of the numbers passed in could be any order. The array will always include at least 2 items. If there are two or more oldest age, then return both of them in array format.

For example (Input --> Output):

[1, 2, 10, 8] --> [8, 10]
[1, 5, 87, 45, 8, 8] --> [45, 87]
[1, 3, 10, 0] --> [3, 10]

P:
edgecases are definded above
R:
should return the 2 highest numbers within the array
E:
examples are above
P:
create a function that takes in an array as a parameter
sort the array in ascending order
pluck out the last 2 integers from the sorted array because they will be the highest values
return the 2 integers that were grabbed
