Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because
 his little brother is better than him

Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it 
will return him an encouraging message :)

If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".
If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".

P: what if no hulas are complete
R: should return the appropriate message depending on how many hulas are made
E:
given more than 10 hulas return message
P:
create a function that takes in an integer
use conditional to check how many hulas complete
return correct message
