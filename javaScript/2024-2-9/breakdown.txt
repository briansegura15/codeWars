Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.

Good luck!

P:
will we be given an empty array? what if we are given a number?
R:
should return the supplied string with all even indexes in caps and all odd indexes in caps seerpately
E:
given above
P:
create a fucntion that takes in a string as a parameter
split the string by "" in order to turn it into an array of chars
create a holder array for the evens
create a holder array for the odds
loop through the array of chars and check each index
if index is even push said index element to array holder including the lowercase odds
if index is odd push said index element to array holder including the lowercase evens
rejoin both arrays to turn into strings
return both strings inside an array
