You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. 
A word can also fit an empty string. If this is not clear enough, here are some examples:

As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.

Example (Input --> Output)

"Hello World" --> "World Hello"
"Hi There." --> "There. Hi"
Happy coding!


P: what if we are given an empty string or a string of integers
R: should return the words in reverse order
E:
given hi there should return there hi
given woohoo there should return there woohoo
given neehaw okdo should return okdo neehaw
P:
create a function that takes in a string as a parameter
split the string into words
reverse the words
rejoin the words
return the words in reverse order
