We need a simple function that determines if a plural is needed or not. 
It should take a number, and return true if a plural should be used with that number or false if not. 
This would be useful when printing out a string such as 5 minutes, 14 apples, or 1 sun.

You only need to worry about english grammar rules for this kata, where anything that isn't singular 
(one of something), it is plural (not one of something).

All values will be positive integers or floats, or zero.

P:
What if the argument is a number or negative
R:
should return true if plural or false if not
E:
given 5 minutes should reeturn true
given 1 plant should reeturn false
given 11 planes should reeturn true
P:
create a function that takes in a number as an argument
determine if that number is plural or singular
return boolean value accordingling
