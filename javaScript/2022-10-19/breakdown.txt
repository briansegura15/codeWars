Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num.
 The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example:

summation(2) -> 3
1 + 2

summation(8) -> 36
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

P: What if a negative number is given or a null value
R: Should return the summation of every number from 1 to num
E:
given 3 should return 6
given 2 should return 3
given 10 should return 55
P:
create af function that takes in a num as a parameter
use some sort of method to summize all numbers between 1 and num
return total
