Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.



P: Y will never be a vowel in this challenge. What if there are no vowels?

R: Return the total amount or count of vowels in a given string

E:
If we are given "Hello", we should return 2
If we are given "Bye", we should return 1
If we are given "Goodnight", we should return 3

P:

We create a function
inside that function we identify and establish what are vowels
we create a loop to shuffle through the given string
we create a variable named count and it starts at 0
if elements in our string match up with vowels then our count goes up by each vowel
return count
