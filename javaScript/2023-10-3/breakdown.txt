Task:
Given a list of integers, determine whether the sum of its elements is odd or even.

Give your answer as a string matching "odd" or "even".

If the input array is empty consider it as: [0] (array with a zero).

Examples:
Input: [0]
Output: "even"

Input: [0, 1, 4]
Output: "odd"

Input: [0, -1, -5]
Output: "even"
Have fun!

P:
we are given the edge case to check if the array is empty
R:
should return odd or even according to the sum of the elements of the array
E:
check above
P:
create a function that takes an array as an argument
use the reduce method on the array in order to add up the elements of said array
use conditional logic to check if the array is even empty or odd
return appropriate answer
