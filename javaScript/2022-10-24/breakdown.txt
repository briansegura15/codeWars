Oh no!
Some really funny web dev gave you a sequence of numbers from his API response as an sequence of strings!

You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.

Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.

ie:["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3]

Note that you can receive floats as well.

P: what if we are given NaN or null or an empty sequence of strings
R: should return the given strings as numbers
E:
given "4 5 6" should return 4 5 6 
given "7 8 9" should return 7 8 9 
given "410 10 610" should return 410 10 610
P:
create a function that takes an array of numbers as strings as a parameter
convert strings to numbers
return numbers
