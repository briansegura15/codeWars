Issue
Looks like some hoodlum plumber and his brother has been running around and damaging your stages again.

The pipes connecting your level's stages together need to be fixed before you receive any more complaints.

Pipes list is correct when each pipe after the first index is greater (+1) than the previous one, and that there is no duplicates.

Task
Given the a list of numbers, return a fixed list so that the values increment by 1 for each index from the minimum value up to the maximum value (both included).

P: 
what if we are given letters or Null or NaN
R: 
should return an array with increments of 1 starting at the lowest value and ending at the highest
E:
given 3 5 8 should return [3 4 5 6 7 8]
given 1 3 5 should return [1 2 3 4 5]
given 1 9 should return [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
P:
create a function that takes in numbers as an argument
find the min and max values
create a holder
loop through the values starting at the min and ending at the max
push said numbers to holder array
