Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples of x.

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).

Examples
countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]

P:
what if the input is NaN or null or empty
R:
should return an array of the first n parameter in multiples of the second x parameter
E:
above
P:
create a function that takes in 2 numbers as parameters
use a loop that pushes
