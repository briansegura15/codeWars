Define a method hello that returns "Hello, Name!" to a given name, 
or says Hello, World! if name is not given (or passed as an empty String).

Assuming that name is a String and it checks for user typos to return a name 
with a first capital letter (Xxxx).

Examples:

* With `name` = "john"  => return "Hello, John!"
* With `name` = "aliCE" => return "Hello, Alice!"
* With `name` not given 
  or `name` = ""        => return "Hello, World!"

  P: what if we are given null or integers as a parameter
  R: should return Hello followed by the first name with the first letter capitalized
  E:
  given joHN should return Hello, John
  given ted should return Hello, Ted
  given carliTOS should return Hello, Carlitos
  P:
  create a function that takes in a name as an argument
  turn all elements of the name to lowercase
  use bracket notation to capitalize the first element of the String
  return full string
