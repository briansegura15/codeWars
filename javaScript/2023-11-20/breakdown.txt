You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

For example(Input --> Output):

10 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
 1 --> [1]

P:
what if parameters are empty or 0 or null or NaN
R:
should return an array with all the numbers up to and including the parameter provided
E:
above
P:
create a function that takes in a number
create an empty array to push to
use a for loop to go through the array and push the numbers to the empty array
return array
