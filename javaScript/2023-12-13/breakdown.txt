Task
You are given a dictionary/hash/object containing some languages and your test results in the given languages. Return the list of languages where your test score is at least 60, in descending order of the scores.

Note: the scores will always be unique (so no duplicate values)

Examples
{"Java": 10, "Ruby": 80, "Python": 65}    -->  ["Ruby", "Python"]
{"Hindi": 60, "Dutch" : 93, "Greek": 71}  -->  ["Dutch", "Greek", "Hindi"]
{"C++": 50, "ASM": 10, "Haskell": 20}     -->  []

P:
we are given an object
use Object.entries on said object to transform the object into an array of key value pairs
use the filter method to check the number on every pair and filter out only the pairs with numbers higher than 60
sort the filtered array in descending order to get the highest pair value back
use the map method to return only the name portion of the key value pair of filtered pairs
