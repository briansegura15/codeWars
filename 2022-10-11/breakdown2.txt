Task
Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).

The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value.

Mind the input validation.

Example
{ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16
{ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6
Input validation
If an empty value ( null, None, Nothing etc. ) is given instead of an array, or the given array is an empty list or a list with only 1 element, return 0.


P: what if the array is empty or null or has strings in it?
R: should return the sum of all the integers in the array without including the highest or lowest elements
E: 
Given  [1, 2, 3, 5] should return 5
Given  [5, 8, 2, 3] should return 8
Given  [7, 1, 3, 5] should return 8
P:
create a function that takes in an array as the parameter
use the .sort method after declaring max and min values
return the sum of the elements in the array minue the max and min
