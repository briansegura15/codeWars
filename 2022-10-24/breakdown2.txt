Your function must return the sum of the even values of this sequence.

Only numbers without decimals like 4 or 4.0 can be even.

The input is a sequence of numbers: integers and/or floats.

P: What if the given sequence is emtpy
R: should return the sum of the even value from the given sequence
E:
given 1 2 3 4 5 should return 6
given 6 7 8 9 should return 14
given 10 11 12  should return 22
P: 
create a function that takes in an array of numbers as a parameter
use the filter method to check which elements in the array are even
add those even elements up using the reduce method
return the sum of those elements
