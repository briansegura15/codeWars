DESCRIPTION:
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of
 cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, 
as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); 
you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA 
at all (again, except for Haskell).

Example: (input --> output)

"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
"GTAT" --> "CATA"

P:
what if we are given null or integers as parameters
R:
should return the complements of each dna letter
E:
given aaa should reutn ttt
given cata should reutn gtat
given tata should reutn atat
P:
create a function that takes in a string as a parameter
use conditional statements to output correct string
return string
