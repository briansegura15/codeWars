Write a function named setAlarm which receives two parameters. 
The first parameter, employed, is true whenever you are employed and the second parameter, 
vacation is true whenever you are on vacation.

The function should return true if you are employed and not on vacation 
(because these are the circumstances under which you need to set an alarm). It should return false otherwise. Examples:

setAlarm(true, true) -> false
setAlarm(false, true) -> false
setAlarm(false, false) -> false
setAlarm(true, false) -> true

P: what if null or nothing is given
R: should return boolean true or false according to combination of arguments
E: above are all possible outcomes
P: 
Create a function that takes in 2 parameters
use conditionals to check those 2 combinations of arguments
return true or false according to combination
